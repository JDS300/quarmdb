		I am looking to use the ingame map files (for future clients) to draw zones dynamically.
		I will need help adjusting the map files to have them draw well.<br />
		<br />
		<a href="/zone/test">This</a> is an example of what I am going for. These
		are one level from NParse Data files.<br />
		<br />
		Any help would be awesome! Thank you!<br />
