		Well it was nice playing with you all. Project Quarm has lost another active player due to
		server incompetence. Don't take me the wrong way, you guys have something great going on here.
		It is just unfortunate that you can't fix the constant crashes on Project Quarm . At the end of
		the day I am at least glad this happened before I donated the $100 I put aside to support this
		project. Oh well sh*t happens and life is not fair, cheers to all of you guys on Project Quarm
		and thanks for the cheese, catch ya later. <br />-Druid<br />
